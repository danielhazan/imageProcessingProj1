this project is privided a solution for project1 in Image Processing course in huji. 
contains functions that reads images and display in RGB or YIQ represenatation, 
clacultes its histogram and quantization. the functions implements excist functions from numpy and scipy libraries
and uses other tools from those libraries for  efficiency matters


Files ->

sol1.py
 contains functions :
 
read_image, imdisplay,
rgb2yiq, yiq2rgb - convert image from rgb repr. into yiq repr and vice varsa
histogram_equalize,quantize
